test reordering adding the ipsec interface and adding the connection

Adding the connection (ipsec add) then adding the interface (ip link)
works; but adding the interface and then the connection fails.

... and (bug) trying to fix things by deleting the interface and
re-adding the connection still fails:

  #1771 after ip link add ipsec1; ipsec add ... connection becomes unloadable
