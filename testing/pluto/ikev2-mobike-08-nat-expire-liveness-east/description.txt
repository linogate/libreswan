IKEv2 connection through NAT that expires; liveness=EAST

- ROAD establishes with EAST, a ping is exchanged.

- to simulate the expire, NIC changes its NAT mapping.

- ROAD tries to send a further ping but gets no response:

  NIC NATs the outbound ESP packet with the NEW NAT port; EAST accepts
  the packet even though the source port is wrong; EAST sends the ESP
  response to the OLD NAT port (kernel state out-of-date); NIC drops
  the packet as the OLD NAT port is invalid.

- EAST sends a liveness probe to the OLD expired port

  NIC drops the packet as the port is invalid.  Eventually EAST's
  liveness probe times out causing it to terminate the connection (no
  delete exchange initiated as the exchange window is full).

- Since ROAD is not performing liveness probes it will never detect
  the failure and instead will be left hanging.

  Hence, mobike={yes,no,nat} should no effect on this test.
